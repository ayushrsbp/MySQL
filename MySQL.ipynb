    "#     * SQL:\n",
    "#         * SQL databases use a structured data model known as the relational model. Data is organized into tables with predefined relationships between them.\n",
    "#         * SQL databases use SQL as the standard query language for interacting with the database.\n",
    "#         * SQL databases have a predefined schema that determines the structure of the data. The schema specifies the tables, columns, data types, and relationships between tables.\n",
    "#     * NoSQL:\n",
    "#         * NoSQL databases use various data models such as key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or column families. The data structure is flexible, allowing for dynamic changes in the data model.\n",
    "#         * NoSQL databases may have their own query languages, but they do not necessarily use SQL.\n",
    "#         * NoSQL databases are often schema-less or have a flexible schema. They allow for dynamic and evolving data structures where each document or object can have different attributes or fields."
